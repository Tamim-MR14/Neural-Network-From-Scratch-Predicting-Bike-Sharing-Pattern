# Neural Network From Scratch Predicting Bike Sharing Pattern
 Buinding a Neural Metwork from scratch and doing hyper-paramter tuning on it to predict how many bi-cycles a bike-sharing company would need on a given hour of a day given some features of historical fashion (e.g. time, temperature, humidity, holidays and weekdays information etc.).
